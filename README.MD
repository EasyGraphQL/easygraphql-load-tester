easygraphql-load-tester will create multiple queries that can be used with your favorite load testing library.

## How to use it

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/EasyGraphQL/easygraphql-load-tester.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

### install

```bash
$ npm install --save easygraphql-load-tester
```

To use it, you must have your server running and follow the next steps:

1. Initialize the class, pass the schema and export test cases
   ```js
    'use strict'

    const fs = require('fs')
    const path = require('path')
    const EasyGraphQLLoadTester = require('easygraphql-load-tester')

    const schema = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'schema.gql'), 'utf8')

    const args = {
      getFamilyInfo: {
        isLocal: true,
        lastNames: '["test 1", "test 2"]',
        age: 20,
        name: 'test'
      }
    }

    const loadTester = new EasyGraphQLLoadTester(schema, args)
    const testCases = loadTester.artillery()

    module.exports = {
      testCases
    }
   ```

  If the Query receives arguments, those should be defined and pass to the class as second arg.

  *If the arg is array it should be added as string `'["test 1", "test 2"]'`*

2. Using [Artillery.io](https://artillery.io/):

  ```shell
  $ npm install -g artillery
  ```
  create `yml` file like this:
  ```yml
    config:
      target: "http://localhost:5000/"
      phases:
        - duration: 5
          arrivalRate: 1
      processor: "./index.js"
    scenarios:
      - name: "GraphQL Query load test"
        flow:
          - function: "testCases"
          - loop:
              - post:
                  url: "/"
                  json:
                    query: "{{ $loopElement.query }}"
              - log: "----------------------------------"
              - log: "Sent a request to the Query: {{ $loopElement.name }}"
            over: cases
  ```

  If you named your `yml` file file `test`, run the test with:
  ```shell
  $ artillery run hello.yml
  ```

3. Result:
  Something like this should be your result with this basic configuration
   ```shell
    All virtual users finished
    Summary report @ 15:03:05(-0500) 2018-11-17
      Scenarios launched:  5
      Scenarios completed: 5
      Requests completed:  40
      RPS sent: 8.95
      Request latency:
        min: 1.2
        max: 13
        median: 2
        p95: 6
        p99: 13
      Scenario counts:
        GraphQL Query load test: 5 (100%)
      Codes:
        200: 40
   ```
